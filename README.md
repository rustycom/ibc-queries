# CosmWasm IBC Demo

*Example IBC enabled contracts along with full stack integration tests*

This package demos how to write a simple pair of IBC-enabled contracts
that speak to each other. It includes unit tests on each contract
in Rust, as well as full stack integration tests on two live blockchains
using [CosmJS](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs) and the
[TS-Relayer](https://github.com/confio/ts-relayer).
